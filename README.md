# NTNU-Laboratory-Report-in-Physics
Unofficial NTNU laboratory report template made by an university student. This template is intended to be used to write a physics laboratory report at university level (undergraduate/ graduate level), but can also be used as a numerical project report and other report types in various other scientific fields (Chemistry, biology, etc.). This template was inspired by various example reports in undergraduate courses in physics at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology).
